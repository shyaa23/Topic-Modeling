# Topic Modeling

**Introduction**

In this repository, topic modelling was performed on twitter data to find what people are tweeting. The sample text dataset was cleaned (unnecessary words, links and stop words were removed, lematized) and finally unsupervised machine learning algorithms, 
specifically latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) were implemented to explore the topics of the tweets. PyLDAvis is a interactive LDA visualization python package which was used to visualize topics.
